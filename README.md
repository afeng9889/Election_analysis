## **Overview of Election Audit**
To find the breakdown of the election results using python.By using the csv file, we can import it into python and create 'for' loops to quickly find requested information from each row.

## **Election-Audit Summary** 
By replacing the csv file, we use this code to track more counties and more candidates. The code has the potential to sort through more than just three. 
Secondly, by modifying the script a little bit, we can also print the runner up and who received the lowest votes in string format.
Lastly, we can also add code to find out how many votes each candidate received from each county.
